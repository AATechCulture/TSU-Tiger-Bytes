## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
**...include the challenge statement(s) the project worked to address**

* How might we create a unified platform for all partner airlines to share and access real-time baggage and customer data?
* How might we ensure customers can access their baggage data seamlessly, irrespective of which partner airline's app they use?
* How can we enhance the travel experience by reducing the uncertainty and stress related to baggage handling across partner airlines?


## Project Description 🤯

SkyTrack+ is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way travelers experience baggage handling, especially during connecting flights across oneworld® alliance partner airlines. By introducing a Unified Baggage Identifier (UBI) and a centralized data repository, we ensure that no matter which airline you're flying with, your baggage is tracked in real-time. Partner airlines push and pull baggage data through standardized interfaces, ensuring a consistent tracking experience. Whether your journey involves a single airline or multiple airline partners, SkyTrack+ offers real-time sync, notifications, and a robust support system to keep passengers informed and at ease. With SkyTrack+, lost luggage and tracking ambiguities become a thing of the past. Experience seamless, transparent, and efficient baggage handling for the modern traveler.

## Project Value 💰

Targeting all travelers using partner airlines, SkyTrack+ significantly simplifies the baggage tracking process. By having a centralized system, airlines reduce redundancy and improve operational efficiency. For travelers, the assurance of being able to track their baggage from any airline app brings peace of mind, reducing travel-related anxiety. This unified approach is expected to boost customer satisfaction and loyalty across all partner airlines, presenting them with a competitive advantage in the market.
